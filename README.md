# OneDB

Hello! This is my first attempt at building a complete project using .net,
I am using VB.NET not because I like it but mainly because I wanted to make use of what is being taught at my University.

## What OneDB is supposed to achieve?

using this application a user can navingate through as many tables in a fixed database: thus named OneDB.
However the application is turning towards a multiDB functoinality very quickly!
This DataBase(MySQL) handling system is mainly for small data jobs like for a college or a uni.
The custom queries from the GUI become little complicated and go way beyond what a user would like to have,
thus i have kept it very usable and simple for the above mentioned use cases.
