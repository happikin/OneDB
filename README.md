# OneDB

Hello! This is my first attempt at building a complete project using .net
I am using VB.NET not because I like it but mainly because I wanted to make use of what is being taught to me at my University.

## What OneDB is supposed to achieve?

using this application a user can navingate through as many tables in a fixed database: thus named OneDB.
